# BBC-Hackathon-Oxwich-15

Created for the BBC Cardiff Hackathon 2015 By the Swansea Oxwhich team

System is a basic working prototype and at current contains bad hard links, test data, the api key they let all the teams have, cross domain error and kittens

##Running
Start by opening login.html
There is no back end so you can't log in but creating a fake profile works, data is GET passed (really should be POST passed) to the profile page which then shows you news you are looking for

##Used Techs

Material Design for bootstrap (which imples bootstrap (which implies jQuery))
The BBC Jucier API
